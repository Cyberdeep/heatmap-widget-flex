# heatmap-widget-flex

This is the heat map widget source code compatible with the [arcgis-viewer-flex (ArcGIS Viewer for Flex)](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-viewer-flex "View repository on GitHub") application.

<!-- MAKE SURE TO ALWAYS UPDATE THE VERSION HERE -->
[![Heatmap widget](./blob/master/heatmap-widget-flex.png "HeatMap Widget")](http://serverapps101.esri.com/webapis/flex-viewer/flexviewer31/index.html?config=heatmap-config.xml)

This repository includes:

* The widget source code.
* The ArcGISHeatMapLayer source code.
* A few non-widget samples to showcase the ArcGISHeatMapLayer.
* Read the [Change Log](./blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for details on what's new.
* Read the [Documentation](./wiki) for getting started using this repository.

## Features
* If you are wanting to produce a heat map layer in your ArcGIS Viewer for Flex application take a look at this widget.
* This widget will allow you to easily create a heat map layer from an ArcGIS for Server service [(Earthquakes service)](http://sampleserver3.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Earthquakes/Since_1970/MapServer/0) that returns point features.
* Only services that return point features are supported.
* Make sure you are familiar with the service you are using to generate your heat map, as services are configured with a "Maximum number of records to return" and this can limit the features used to generate your heat map.  At ArcGIS version 10.1 this number is 1000 by default.  See the [FAQ](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/flex-api/concepts/index.html#/FAQ/017p00000016000000/) for more information related to this topic.
